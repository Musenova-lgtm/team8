Interactive Kanban CLI

A lightweight, interactive command-line Kanban board built entirely with Go's standard library. This application allows teams and individuals to manage tasks directly from the terminal, keeping data persistent across runs. 

Features:
Interactive Menu: Easily create, update, delete, and view tasks. 


Progress Tracking: Tasks move through three sequential statuses: todo ➔ inprogress ➔ done. 


Data Persistence: Automatically saves and loads tasks to/from a flat file database. 


Input Validation: Built-in protection against invalid IDs, empty strings, and bad menu choices to prevent application crashes. 


Russian Language Support: Beautiful terminal table auto-aligns properly even when task titles contain Cyrillic characters. 


Requirements
Go 1.16 or higher 


Only standard Go library packages used (no external dependencies) 


How to Run

System Rules & Data Format
Menu Actions
Create Task: Prompts for a title, generates a unique ID (max_id + 1), and initializes the status as todo. 


Advance Status: Moves a task forward step-by-step (todo ➔ inprogress ➔ done). 


Delete Task: Removes a task permanently from the system by its ID.

All Tasks: Displays a beautifully formatted board with all tasks. 


Filter by Status: Allows viewing only tasks matching a specific status (todo, inprogress, or done). 


Edit Title: Renames an existing task title by its ID. 


Exit: Safely terminates the program execution. 


Storage Format
All tasks are persisted in the root directory inside tasks.txt. The data is structured using a semicolon-separated line format: 

text
id;status;title
Use code with caution.

Example contents of tasks.txt: 

text
1;todo;Setup project
2;inprogress;Write code
3;done;Review pull request
Use code with caution.

Note: Any malformed lines containing fewer than 3 fields are skipped on load.
